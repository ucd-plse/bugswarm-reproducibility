ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements/lint-only.txt (line 1) and pyflakes==1.2.3 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested pyflakes==1.2.3
    flake8 2.5.4 depends on pyflakes<1.1 and >=0.8.1

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict

ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements/lint-only.txt (line 1) and mccabe==0.5.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested mccabe==0.5.0
    flake8 2.5.4 depends on mccabe<0.5 and >=0.2.1

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict

ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements/lint-only.txt (line 1) and pyflakes==1.2.3 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested pyflakes==1.2.3
    flake8 2.5.4 depends on pyflakes<1.1 and >=0.8.1

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
